# Final Report - Ceylonara AI

## Introduction

The tea industry has been a cornerstone of Sri Lanka's economy for over a century, with Ceylon Tea recognized globally for its exceptional quality. Despite its significance, the industry faces numerous challenges including disease management issues, communication gaps between stakeholders, and increasing global competition.

The sector is currently challenged by inefficiencies in disease management and quality assessment systems, exacerbated by reliance on manual, labor-intensive processes that cannot meet the demands of modern agricultural practices.¹ Tea cultivation involves a complex ecosystem of farmers, estate managers, factories, and exporters, with traditional management methods becoming increasingly inefficient in today's digital age.

Disease management represents a critical challenge. According to Pandian et al. (2023), grey blight disease alone has caused 17-46% crop loss in India and reduced tea production by up to 50% in major tea-growing regions of China.² When disease outbreaks occur, farmers must physically transport leaf samples to agricultural offices or wait for extension officers, causing delays that lead to disease spread and economic losses.

Communication between stakeholders remains largely manual and prone to delays. The tea leaf collection process involves multiple phone calls, paper-based records, and inefficient routing, leading to quality degradation before leaves reach factories. Small-scale farmers lack access to expert knowledge on disease identification and treatment, while factories struggle to coordinate leaf collection and maintain consistent quality standards.

Research by Park et al. (2020) on plant disease recognition systems using convolutional neural networks and Zhang et al. (2019) on machine vision for tea quality monitoring demonstrates the potential for technological solutions in the tea industry.

The Ceylonara AI project addresses these challenges through an automated, computer vision-based system for tea quality and disease detection. This integrated platform combines disease detection, quality assessment, and communication tools tailored to Sri Lankan tea plantations. By leveraging artificial intelligence and user-friendly interfaces, the system enhances productivity, improves quality, and fosters better coordination across the tea production value chain.

This technological intervention represents a significant step toward ensuring the sustainability and global competitiveness of Sri Lanka's tea industry in the 21st century.
